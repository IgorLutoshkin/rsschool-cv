## My way

I want to become a professional developer, constantly develop and learn new technologies. Now the task is to study the frontend, but in the future I plan to study the backend as well.

My strengths are probably the fact that the development process itself drags me down. That is, a kind of "masachism" in programming, when everything fails and I can't solve the problem, and I don't even know how to do it. This motivates me to look for and come up with algorithms and ways to solve the problem. And of course, that feeling of euphoria when you were able to solve the problem, for which you do not give up and go forward))

I don't have much experience, except that I can add a certificate for learning Python, I'm also currently studying HTML and CSS on my own, I have basic skills working with the Git version control system. Unfortunately, there is not much time left for studying now, but I try to devote every free minute to programming.
